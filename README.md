# cannelloni-rust (wip)

This is a work in progress port of Maximilian GÃ¼ntner's [cannelloni](https://github.com/mguentner/cannelloni) CAN-over-IP tunneling
software.
The main point of building this is for me to get up-to-scratch with async and some other Rust aspects. I do plan to get
it into a stable and functional state eventually though.

## Contributing

Until the software has reached a functional state, I would prefer to work on it alone. If you absolutely want to
contribute something, please open an issue and we can discuss.

## License

In accordance with the wishes of the original author, this software is licensed under AGPL v3. See ```COPYING.LESSER```
